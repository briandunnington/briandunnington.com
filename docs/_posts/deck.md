The back deck isnt quite finished, but it is close. Check out the transformation:

Footings poured

Because the septic tank is close to the house, we had to frame around the openings so we could cut out some access covers

Here is the lower portion with the decking in process

We have to finish the decking on the upper portion, and then tackle the steps and railings, but at least it is semi-functional at this point.
