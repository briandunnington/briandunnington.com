While looking for some good hikes on the island, I came across Double Bluff. It was supposed to have a few miles of forested trails, but it turned out to be a cool place to hike along the beach instead. My first visit was kind of rushed since I was trying to hurry back, but Michaleen and Eden and I have made a couple of return trips to collect shells and play in the (very cold) water. It is fun to watch the clams squirting water up into the air like some kind of big erratic fountain and to see the (literally) millions of shells from clams, mussels, oysters, snails, crabs, barnacles, and all kinds of other interesting sea life. On the last trip, we also saw three big cruise ships go by, possibly on their way to Alaska. Those things are gigantic! Maybe next time I will get a picture.
