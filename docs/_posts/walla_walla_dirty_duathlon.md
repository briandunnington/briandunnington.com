Chris found out about an interesting-sounding event down in Walla Walla called the [Dirty Duathlon][WWDD]. It consists of running 2.7 miles, biking 15.4 miles, then running the same 2.7 miles again. I headed over to the Tri-Cities to meet up with Chris and we headed down.

Prior to the race, it had been pouring rain, and even as we were checking in, it was coming down in sheets. The race must go on though, and we took off into what had become a giant muddy mess.

No photos from during the actual race, but you can see the after affects from these photos:

In the end, we still had smiles on our faces behind all of the mud.
