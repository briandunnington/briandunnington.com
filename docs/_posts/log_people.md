We had a big windstorm last night and heard a big **crash** early this morning. Upon inspection, we saw that a big tree fell down in our front yard, breaking our fence and blocking the road in the process. We went out in the pre-dawn hours when it was barely light enough to see and started cutting up the logs to clear the road.

Michaleen had a great idea though so we took some of the new logs and made some holiday people, complete with curly hair and fancy hats. We placed them out at our driveway and the entrance to our neighborhood and they were immediately a big hit.
