On the eve of our big training trip up in the White Mountains, Brad found out at the last minute that the Big Sky Breakdown in Montana had been cancelled. Their website still says 'Registration is now open', and apparently Brad was the first person to hear the news. The organizers said that they had already had a fair amount of teams commit to doing it, but they had started planning too late and the course was still up in the air. They didnt want to put on their first race without it being top notch.

Anyway, it is a bummer to not be doing it. But maybe something else will pop up.
