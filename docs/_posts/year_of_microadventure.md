At the beginning of this year, I decided that I was going to do at least one [#microadventure][Microadventures] each month during 2015. There really werent any rules about it other than each adventure had to involve sleeping outside. I started out with a great overnight [hike at Wallace Falls][WallaceFalls] in January and a fun [bike trip to Goldmyer Hot Springs][Goldmyer] in February. There was also the big [Paddle to the Sea Summer Adventure][PaddleToTheSea] in July, but I didnt blog much about the other trips. I did however continue to get out each month and achieved my goal of an adventure every month.

The full list:

* January - Hiking at Wallace Falls
* February - Biking at Goldmyer Hot Springs
* March - Camping at Griffin Creek Natural Area
* April - Kayak at Dugualla Bay
* May - Hiking at Skyline Ridge
* June - Camping at Baker Lake
* July - Climbing, hiking, and kayaking from Mt. Baker to the sea
* August - Hiking at Ozette Triangle
* September - Camping in my own woods
* October - Biking at Bainbridge Island
* November - Kayaking at Deception Pass
* December - Snow biking and snowshoeing at Nason Creek
