I dont know how many of you were lucky enough to get to see the 'interesting' cellar door that was in the house when I first moved in. For those that werent so lucky, imagine a giant trap door in the middle of my dining room, that was first tiled over, and then re-cut out so it could still open. Between scratching up the wall, weighing about 100 pounds, and just being incovenient, I knew it had to go. I ripped it out and then was left with the dilemna of how to construct something better. I figured out a ladder-type access that would take up less than half the space, and not interfere with anything else in the room. I did the initial construction a while back, but never got around to finishing it. Well, it is finally done! I was a little worried about what it would end up looking like, but I think it turned out pretty nice. Here are a couple of pictures so you dont have to use your imagination.
