Wrapped up some work on the treehouse awhile ago, but never posted the pictures, so you here go:

Finally replaced the aluminum extension ladder with a real ladder - very sturdy and nice

Up the ladder...

We made the railing out of some fallen trees from around our property

View from the yard

The treehouse is not quite done - still needs a handrail on the ladder and some window screens, but constructions is wrapped up for the winter.
