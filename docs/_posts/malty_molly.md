<div style="BORDER: #aab29d 4px solid; PADDING: 10px; background-color:#256040;color:#948f29;margin-right:20px;"><span style="font-size:120%;">That Malty Molly</span><p style="color:#948F29;">She blew into my life during Octoberfest and while our back-and-forth only lasted a month, I feel like I have known her all my life. Molly's the type of red-head that does not take things seriously, but when it comes to making beer, she believes that additives and ales don't mix.</p><p style="color:#948F29;">When I think back on this full-bodied lass, all that I can say is that she was dying to get out...and I just couldn't keep her contained. </p></div>
