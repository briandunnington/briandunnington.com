Michaleen, Eden, her friend Carson, and I headed to the mainland and did some kayaking on Lake Union. It was really fun kayaking with the skyscrapers and Space Needle in the background, and checking out all of the ships and floating houseboats was also really interesting. Eden and Carson also had a great time exploring at Gas Works park. Pretty great day!
