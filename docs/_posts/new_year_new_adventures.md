Continuing the theme from last year, I am trying to sneak in one #microadventure each month. This month, I didn't have to travel too far from home to find a completely secluded spot. Even though I could see Deception Pass bridge in the distance, my special spot ensured that there were no other folks around and anybody who wants to have this same view will have to work for it a bit.

A beautiful sunset followed by a crystal clear night under the stars is definitely not the worst way to spend a cool January night. Why not get out there and have a little [microadventure][Microadventures] of your own?
