I may never finish my Lego stop-motion film, so I am going to share it with the world as-is. This was my first attempt at a proper film, and I learned a lot about the process while making it. It is not very long (and has almost no plot), but it took a surprising amount of work just to get this far.

Anyway, enjoy it in all of its unfinished glory:
