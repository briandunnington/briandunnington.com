The folks that put on the San Juan Island Quest adventure race that [I did a few years ago][SanJuanIslandQuest] had a new race in Bellingham this year called the Kulshan Quest. Six hours of kayaking, biking, and trekking in the waters and woods near Chuckanut Bay on a gorgeous summer solstice day - can't really beat that!
