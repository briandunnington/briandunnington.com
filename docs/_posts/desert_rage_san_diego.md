This past weekend was Desert Rage - San Diego, the third race in the Desert Rage series and the first one I had done outside of Arizona. The event took place on Lake Hodges, and although i had high hopes of spotting [Hodgee][], he was nowhere to be seen that day.

As for the race, it was 11+ miles of kayaking, about 9 miles of trekking, and 13-ish miles of mountain biking for a grand total of almost 34 miles. I finished 4th in the solo division, which wasnt all that great of a finish, but I was still pretty happy with the outcome.

You can check out the full results and a bunch of pictures on the [Sierra Adventure Sports website][Results].
