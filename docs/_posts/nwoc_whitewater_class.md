I love living on an island and the plentiful sea kayaking opportunities, but I really wanted to start whitewater kayaking as well. I signed up for a week long total-immersion class with Northwest Outdoor Center and it was a blast. I learned a lot and just generally had a super fun time. Highly recommended!
