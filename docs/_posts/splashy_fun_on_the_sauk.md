Got out kayaking on the middle section (Whitechuck to Backman Park) of the Sauk this past Saturday and it was a great time. Beautiful sunny day and fun whitewater - not the worst way to spend the day!

*(You can see me flip just after 4 minutes in, and the best whitewater is about 5 minutes in if you are just looking for the good stuff).*
