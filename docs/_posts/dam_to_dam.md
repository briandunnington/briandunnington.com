Paddled in the Tempe Town Lake Dam-To-Dam kayak race yesterday ([http://www.damtodamevents.com/index.html][DamToDam]). This was the second year of the event, and my second time participating in it. Last year I did it solo in the recreational division. This year, I talked michaleen into doing it with me and we competed in the tandem kayak class. Thanks to Rick Eastman for letting us borrow his two-man kayak for the event. We even came home with a first place finish (nevermind the fact that we were the only entry in our division) =)
