After over 10 years in this house, we are moving on (though just a few miles down the road).

When we bought the place, it was just a house on a dirt lot with weeds taller than my head. We spent countless hours both inside and out to make it a truly great place to live. Loads of great memories here and I will definitely miss it.

Although we spent a ton of time working on the place, we also got to spend a lot of time enjoying it as well. Even as we were selling the house, I enjoyed just going over there and sitting on the deck and watching the trees sway in the breeze.

Thanks Scenic - you were a great house!
