Here is my second attempt at a montage clip for the [Brickfest][] montage. It is not technically perfect, but I had a lot of fun making it, and hopefully it is recognizable even though the movie is over 40 years old.

Here are some of the things that I wished I had improved upon:

* Animation ended up a little herky-jerky because I had to slow it down a bit to match up with the audio
* The zoom/pan was much faster than in the real movie, but again I had to match up my animation with the audio
* The set was so tight that I had to use some extra legos to move the knife-wielder, and then forgot to mask them out, so they are visible in a few shots
* The lighting is very close to the original, but not exact. The knife-wielder should have been more shadowy
* The 'scream' mouth. I didnt have any appropriate minifig heads, so I had to draw the mouth in Photoshop. Not my best work, but better than the version I originally did
* I was generally happy with the water effect for the shower, although it is not quite as obvious after the compression

Anyway, let me know what you think.
