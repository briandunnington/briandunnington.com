After about a seven year hiatus, I competed in another adventure race this past Saturday. I saw a actually saw poster for the [San Juan Island Quest][SanJuanIslandQuest] while riding the ferry and thought it sounded like fun. Although they offered a 12-hour course as well, I decided that the 6-hour course was a better idea, so I signed up, loaded up my truck, and headed over to beautiful Orcas Island.

The competition milling about

After a bit of delay, we got started at 12:15. First off was the mountain biking leg, which required a long, steep climb and then some fast, fun downhill. Unfortunately, it seemed like more up than down to me, but it was a beautiful area and I couldnt complain at all.

Checkpoint #2

Then it was on to the kayaking. The sun was just coming out and the water was smooth as glass. Great day to be out on the lake paddling.

After a short bike back to the HQ, it was off to the trekking portion. I am not a runner, but I used some good navigation to pick up a few places by being smart instead of fast.

After the last checkpoint, we had to canoe a couple hundred yards and then return to the finish line. I came in around 6:25pm or so, putting me just barely over the 6-hour mark. Out of 14 teams, I came 7th, which I was pretty happy with. (The guy who won runs ultra-marathons in the Alps for a hobby, so I didnt feel too bad).

Anyway, it was a great course, beautiful day, and overall fun event. Definitely planning on doing it again next year!
