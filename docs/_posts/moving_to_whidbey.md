Well, my house finally sold. It was a quick and easy closing, so that part was nice. The worst part was moving out - not the house (since i dont have hardly any possessions), but the garage, since it was filled with hundreds of landcruiser parts of all shapes and sizes. I actually missed out on all of the fun of the move since I was out of the state at the time, but Michaleen and her girls saved the day by handling it all for me. I owe them big time.

Anyway, now that I am out of my old house, it was time to turn the attention to finding a new place up on Whidbey Island. Since we arent sure what our long-term plan is, we decided that renting a place for now was the best idea. We found a great place that is on 5 treed acres on top of a hill, with great views of the Puget Sound, mainland, and Cascade mountains. You can see the view in a couple of these pictures.

This last picture is of the house we are renting. We have only seen the outside and peeked in a few windows, so we dont even know what the inside looks like yet. Guess it will be fun to find out when we arrive up there next month.
