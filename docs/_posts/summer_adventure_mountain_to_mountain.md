This year's Summer Adventure idea was cooked up by Chris: how about we climb Mt. Adams, mountain bike over to Mt. St. Helens, and climb that as well?

After the last couple of adventures and too many Lost Paddle Awards<sup>â„¢</sup> to list, I was definitely worried about our chances of success. But in the end, we didn't have any (major) issues, completed the entire adventure, and even had a little bit of fun doing it.
