I wanted to try a springtime ascent of Mt. St. Helens and do some snowshoeing in the process, so I headed out in late April to do a little overnight trip. The route is different than the summertime route and follows the 'Worm Flows' route instead.

I snowshoed in a ways and made camp for the night. I had my tent and my stove and a nice protected spot and settled right in.

Although the weather had been great for my approach, the next day the weather started getting worse and worse. As I neared the summit, it turned into full-on whiteout conditions and I couldnt tell the ground from the sky or which way was up. I sat and tried to wait it out, but it just kept getting wetter and windier so I finally turned around feeling a little defeated. I will be back to try again next year though.
