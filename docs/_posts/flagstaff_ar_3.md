It was a beautiful day to race up in flagstaff - the weather was great, the leaves were changing colors, and Mark put together a fun race for the series finale. Team Sierra Adventure Sports was hoping to do well following their 1st place division finish at the last race. Alas, it was not our day and we finished 3rd (out of only three teams in our division) and only a couple places up from being last overall.

However, since we did well in the previous two races of the season, our 3rd place finish was enough to keep us in the lead in the points series, so I am happy to announce that Team Sierra Adventure Sports takes 1st place in the 3-person division for the 1st annual Flagstaff Mountain Racing Series. We even got a little trohpy and some cool prizes for our achievement. As Rick said later, "we raced against Monster, and we were the ones who came home with the trophy" (even if that statement is slightly misleading).
