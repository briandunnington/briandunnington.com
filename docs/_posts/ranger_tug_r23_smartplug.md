Continuing the theme of boat modifications, the latest project was to replace the shore power plug with a [SmartPlug][]. The standard plugs are notorious for having issues, and lots of boats catch fire every year due to electrical fires caused by these plugs.

Luckily, the swap out for the SmartPlug is super easy - it uses the same wiring and same bolt pattern, so it really just takes a few minutes to have a much safer connection.

While I was messing with the shore power wiring anyway, I took the opportunity to add a [galvanic isolator][galvanic]. I dont know exactly how it works, but it prevents other boats at the marina that are also on shore power from using your anodes. Newer boats come with a galvanic isolator already installed, but our 2018 didnt have one. The entire process was simply:

- disconnect ground (green) wire from back of shore power receptacle (SmartPlug in my case)
- using marine-grade water-tight butt connector, extend that wire so it is long enough to reach galvanic isolator (mounted on inside of stern)
- from other side of galvanic isolator, run a new wire back to the shore power receptacle

In the end, both jobs together took less than an hour, and that was with me triple-checking every step. Small amount of work for a lot of extra piece of mind - highly recommended!
