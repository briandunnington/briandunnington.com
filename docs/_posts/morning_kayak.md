Today was my second time out for a morning kayak on Puget Sound (in the Saratoga Passage, to be exact). Last weekend was the Langley 'Welcome the Whales' festival, so I have been really hoping to see a whale during my kayaking. Today I didnt see a whale, but I did see a huge sea lion who was about 25 feet from my kayak in the middle of the sound. I thought it was just a big piece of driftwood at first, until I got closer and heard him breathing and blowing water out of its nose. He didnt seem to mind my presence too much, and after a little while, he dove his head under, flipped up his tail, and was gone. I wasnt able to grab a picture of him, but here are some pictures of the sound in the morning - very peaceful.
