Our Soup Box Derby racer was pulled out of retirement (and out of the weeds that had grown over it) for the 2014 race. We won two out of three of our heats, which isnt too bad for a couple of bikes we found on the side of the road, bolted together, and strapped a kayak on top of.

*Nemo's Nemesis* has now officially been retired and we will be back with an all-new racer next year!
