We raced the [kayak-strapped-to-two-bikes][2010] for the [a couple of years][2014], and then made some modifications and [raced it again in 2015][2015]. After taking a few years off, we were back at it this year with a brand new racer.

We teamed up with Robin and Tim (the mayor - fancy!) to build a Seussmobile full of floo-flounders and jing-janglers.

We used lots of feather boas and PVC and bits of an old drum kit. The local newspaper even did a story about us.

Come race day, we donned our costumes and unveiled the racer. We werent the fastest racer, but were most definitely the crowd favorite. All in all, it was a super fun racer to build and to race.
