April is nearly over but I realized that I never posted about my March #microadventure. I paddled from Whidbey across Saratoga Passage over to Camano Island State Park. It was great weather (especially for March) and I spent most of the time just lounging around on the beach. I camped out overnight and paddled back the next day for a very relaxing and enjoyable quick trip.
