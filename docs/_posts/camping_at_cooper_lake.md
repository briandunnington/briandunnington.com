A couple of weekends ago we went camping at Cooper Lake, north of Cle Elum. We had originally planned to go to Wind River, but we didnt want to spend the whole weekend driving, so we found an alternate site that was a little closer to home. We tried to do some fishing, but didnt catch anything. The area was beautiful though, and we were able to kayak and read and just generally relax.
