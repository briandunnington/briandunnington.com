After racing the [kayak-strapped-to-two-bikes][2010] for the [past couple of years][2014], we decided to make some changes. This year we removed the kayak in favor of a couple of old office chairs and a cinder block. Not the prettiest machine out there, but definitely fun to build and race.

As you can see in the clip above, we fell behind to the chicken racers early but just about caught up right at the finish line and lost by a hair. All in all, quite an entertaining way to spend a Sunday on Whidbey Island.
