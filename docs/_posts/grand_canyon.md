Summary: I lived in Arizona for 7 years and never saw the Grand Canyon, but Chris and I decided it was time to check it out.

I moved to Arizona in 1999 and had big ideas of hiking the Grand Canyon as much as time would allow. Well, I moved away from Arizona in 2006 and never visited the Grand Canyon a single time.

Fast-forward several years though and Chris suggested we take a long weekend and hike the canyon from rim to rim. Sounded like a great idea to me, so we flew out, rented a car, and drove up to the south rim.

The next morning, we took a shuttle around to the north rim and began our hike. It was really an amazing hike and fun to keep descending into the canyon deeper and deeper.

We intended to stay over night at the bottom of the canyon and hike out the next day, but that is where things took a turn for the worse. I ended up getting very very sick (perhaps food poisioning) and was up all night vomiting. We still had to hike from the base up to the rim though, so we packed up and headed out - me making pit stops every 15 minutes or so to throw up. =(

At one of the ranger stations on the way out, one of the rangers said I really did not look well and suggested we stay there for a bit. They gave me some anti-nausea pills and I took a nap for a couple of hours. Once rested, I still didnt feel great, but we donned our packs once again and hiked up and out.

Even with the sickness, it was a great trip and I hope to go back someday and do it again - minus the vomiting.
