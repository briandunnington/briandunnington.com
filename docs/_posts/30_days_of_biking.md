About a month ago, I heard about a challenge called [30 Days of Biking][30dob]. It is just what it sounds like: you ride your bike every day for 30 days straight during the month of April. I thought is sounded like fun, so I decided to take part.

I have to confess that I did skip two days while I was sick, but I did go for some extra rides on other days to make up for it. Each day, I took a picture during my ride and now that the challenge is over, I decided to compile the pictures into a single image that represents the entire month.

I tried to explore new places and not get stuck in a routine of the same old rides, which made it really fun to get out and ride each day. The official #30DaysOfBiking only takes place once a year, but why wait? Get out there and start riding your bike today!
