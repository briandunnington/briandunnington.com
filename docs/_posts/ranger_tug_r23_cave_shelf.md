The R23 packs a lot into a small space, but that also means that every square inch is precious. I saw a [post on the Tugnuts forum where user Hamster had built a custom shelf][hamster] for the 'cave' (1/4 berth) area to store his butane stove and accessories. We also have a similar butane stove and I thought this was a great idea, so I decided to copy him =)

I started this project last fall, but had to put the boat into winter storage before we could put it to use. It really wasnt too hard other than the fact that nothing is square so it took a bit of trial and error to get all of the angles just right.

(And yes, I know about the dangers of storing propane in an enclosed space - this is just a test)
