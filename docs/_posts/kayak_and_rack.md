A few months ago, I got a new sea kayak but never put up a picture of it. I havent gotten to use it nearly as much I would have liked since I didnt have an easy way to transport it (at 17' long, I couldnt just throw it in the bed of my truck like I can with my swifty). But I finally got a good rack setup so I can haul the thing around.
